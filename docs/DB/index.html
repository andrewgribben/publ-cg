Each team is run by one or other of the myriad corporations within The Corporation. Some make this obvious, such as the Trontek 29ers or the Shill Industries Nightmares; others go for the showmanship of names like The Beasts or the simplicity of a place name and a trade – for example, the Prosperion Prospectors. A few, like the Midgard Serpents, are inspired by ancient mythology.</p><p id="c7519e959c584253974b5b120f236acd">Team names are often related to the race(s) of their players as part of being a successful DreadBall team is the showmanship, story and spectacle you bring. Although the Co-Prosperity Sphere is mainly human and wars are fought against Forge Fathers, marauding Orx and so on, this doesn’t mean that all other races are bad. Many of them are DreadBall fans too!</p><p id="761f42dd3fba40ae8392ab76e0dd7520">All of the non-human teams have dramatic histories describing how they came to be playing DreadBall, and some of them are even true! More common than the unadorned truth is a degree of artistic license and exaggeration that everyone knows is there, but all ignore because it makes the whole spectacle more exciting. It’s a bit of escapism for the crowds, and nobody is interested in the mundanities of the real workings behind the scenes. DreadBall is a sort of combination of sport, carnival and soap opera, all rolled together to form a unique and compelling blend.</p><figure class="full-bleed" id="1ffa08f6f34248ed8a56a506621ac69c"><img src="img/season01/dreadballteamshero_2x.jpg" id="738c4f98177d420ea138a4a159162293" /></figure><p id="fffa47869f464525a3cdc1722ee87f8c"><br /></p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 41" id="57e6fd1a83ae4c1e920e5523a2b90155"><div class="section" id="a8f99c34d52140f5ab25b953b9a61862"><div class="layoutArea" id="00bb5bda00ab43708e5f918722262f87"><div class="column" id="30487c386fd7440dbc3043c10da006e2"><h4 id="37f90b91fe624c149bdfbf0800a47542">Team Types</h4><p id="3a826a23330547e0b348e9c6e85f39b7">Each starting team roster is strictly controlled by the DGB, and each must conform to one of the recognised (and approved) formats. This means that all starting teams of a given type are identical. See the following pages for the initial line-ups of the four most common team types.</p><p id="94821a7fe78a448f961f1cdf4281487b">This limitation of initial team rosters allows the DGB to ensure fair, balanced and interesting games for the crowds to watch. Of course, as soon as you join a league and get a few matches under your belt the team will change and grow, but that too is fun for the fans to follow.</p><p id="21a69972feca499b9e94aee4c36589c2">Rather than list them as simply “human teams”, “Veer-myn teams”, etc, each of the four types is described as a famous example – just as they were when they started out. This gives you a better idea of the character and history you can include in a team and acts as a sort of template for you to invent your own. Of course, if you want to, then simply use the examples given here!</p><div class="page" title="Page 41" id="e8d327368a58464fa3db36d50027e9a6"><div class="section" id="711b153c225241aa907e2578a5816d25"><div class="layoutArea" id="83fa7cbf12b44fcbb7a217bf9d385339"><div class="column" id="c47f87da789340e086d3d8b74804ee54"><h4 id="29ab731a3bf3481b96396689d3561928">Starting Your Team</h4><p id="f07520c7bc2d4cef8de7b84b4a875edb">Every team starts with 8 players, but each type of team has a different combination of player roles. Have a look at the different rosters, read their descriptions and look at the models. One of the teams will appeal to you more than the others, and this is the one you should play. Don’t worry about why you chose it or which is “the best” – they’re all balanced and in the hands of a skilled Coach they can all win.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><h4 id="68ea560599254c6fad5e7d5e2368c4f5">Reading a Team Roster</h4><p id="f4d87268ba2a4e3098bf625ae5ebe070">This is mostly self-explanatory.

Obviously you’ll need a team name. You can use one of the examples in this book or make up your own. Players need names too, though I’d save nicknames for later. These will naturally suggest themselves as a result of game events and are much more fun when tied into a history you share with your gaming buddies. Add all these names to the roster.</p><p id="f354a8b2e73c4db2a67a4c82b51c0ad0">You can also decide on team colours, a fancy logo and even a team song if you’re feeling creative.

There’s lots you can do to make your team unique.</p><div class="page" title="Page 42" id="e6974962019b4a1cb3bef7d5371cf001"><div class="section" id="717f25649178442595ea5996c72168c9"><div class="layoutArea" id="d47c7c63a1ff4e71b21ef785381fbaf6"><div class="column" id="3cc398f3a1094a18ad2b6744e0d256fd"><p id="f056ba9e15d84501933820abbd1a0c4f">Of course, you won’t get far without models to play with, so you’ll need to ensure that you’ve got a set of the appropriate miniatures for your team. Ideally these should be painted<br />in whatever team colours you’ve decided on. However, to start with the most important thing is that they are the right models so that your opponent can tell at a glance what type each player is (Striker, Guard or Jack) and they have their player number on somewhere. The numbered positions on the team roster need to match the number on the player’s shirt. This is so that they can be picked out at random for some of the game events, both good and bad. You can paint the numbers on, use waterslide transfers or – if they aren’t painted yet - just write the numbers on the model’s base.<br />The most important thing is that they can easily be identified.</p><p id="0555604f890946cba0242f26b13585a8">Now, with your team roster all organised and a matching set of models to represent the players, all you need is an opponent!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><h2 id="id-trontek">Trontek 29ers</h2><div class="page" title="Page 43" id="e08066af80674c58a0d4c85778f4a321"><div class="section" id="40af1bd24f62435cb48f34686a2dac97"><div class="layoutArea" id="a46d8d8a569d475fb3fae29843443b7a"><div class="column" id="277c54efd63b4b6c9e17ed21c1458ca5"><figure class="one-half left" id="d563a258f9de4b6b9776c164c3f0eedb"><img src="img/season01/introman_2x.jpg" id="3eefae7b673a4a69b3c5bc9d36859a0e" /></figure><p id="7e21d2e7ae9740719d47213813e20bd0">The ever-present logo of Trontek Industries reaches into every aspect of the lives of an average citizen in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, so it is hardly surprising that their team is one of the most highly regarded of the major leagues.</p><p id="90c7668280b34e8b96e78576ea13c6d1">Genetically pure human teams are the most common type in the major leagues, simply because that’s what most of the citizens of the Co-Prosperity Sphere are!

Trontek muscled out any attempts at competition for almost 80 years, and until very recently all DreadBall kit was made by them.

Eventually they found some recordings of DreadBall games in the entertainment suite of the MVV Bilge Rat and, with little to do for months on end, started playing games among themselves. As their raids began to focus on stealing DreadBall equipment, they soon came to the notice of Digby, who decided to strike a deal and bring their raw talent to the big leagues.</p><p id="60934f09879e46bba80108e8263d30bd">True to their origins, only Orx and Goblins can join the ranks of the Smackers and their imitators. It’s not always easy to get quality recruits, but then Goblins are known for their low standards at everything other than sliding out of trouble (and running away), so they’re happy to make do. Orx, on the other hand, can always be relied upon to thump things with little or no formal training.</p><div class="page" title="Page 45" id="f9c8d8edf7c543648620930644dd7571"><div class="section" id="6c9bd9a502d84ad38c94b40d7a4edda5"><div class="layoutArea" id="b36f52597b774a72a1089abe8bc0901a"><div class="column" id="9765f0b327a04893b9087d13d294a85c"><p id="9279f88ea68d4f62abda9e8c723c2ebf">Orx and Goblins have different strengths and make an interesting combination. The most obvious tactic starts with using the brute might of the Orx to smash as many of your opponents as possible. Once there are few of them left standing, the fact that the Goblins are prone to dropping the ball is less of a worry. Sometimes it’s a problem not having Strikers, though you do get the best Guards to make up for it.</p><p id="4556b373000d44d39f9f104251951fab">Remember that you can play this team either as the Greenmoon Smackers themselves, or as your own team of green-skinned miscreants.

There are so many DreadBall fans that they couldn’t help but hear all about it! Their most famous team of all is the Skittersneak Stealers – winners of the Thudweiser League in ’37 and ’39, and holder of more “Most Fouls” awards than any other team in DreadBall’s history.</p><p id="744d582620414597a80d154c4c781ad4">Veer-myn are not really a natural race for DreadBall. They have terrible depth perception and their nervous twitchiness gives them real trouble when catching the ball. It is a testament to their enthusiasm and perseverance that they can play at all, and they do play pretty well. They only take Veer- myn recruits, choosing the best from the vast array of hopefuls who constantly step forward to try out for every team.</p><div class="page" title="Page 47" id="1337dee09ad44e02b34a9290233f10e0"><div class="section" id="f42adacdbb2c4d719eba399c917180d8"><div class="layoutArea" id="123dd1c6c75944da97133325b0dcdabf"><div class="column" id="74e22bb297ad4b95bf28746b6a2c4158"><p id="092c3208b6c44e0199e63932f361e5e8">With a clarity of self-realisation uncommon in sport, the Veer-myn focus their training on the area they are naturally weakest at. The idea is that training will compensate for<br />a lack of innate talent and, to a degree, this works. This concentration gives you teams comprised mostly of highly trained Strikers, with a smattering of hardier rats as Guards. With a habit of making way more scoring chances than every other team, but missing far more of them, Veer-myn teams are not for Coaches with a nervous disposition or weak heart.</p><p id="755f5910d9c04329ae9593a3e203b961">Remember that you can play this team either as the Skittersneak Stealers themselves, or as your own team of rats.
